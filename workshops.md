**COMPUTING for RESILIENCE: Expanding Community Knowledge & Impact**  

Miami, a city at the forefront of physical, economic, and climatic challenges, serves as a microcosm of global issues and a hub for innovative solutions. The 2025 ACADIA conference, in collaboration with [Florida International University](/fiu) and the [University of Miami](/um), invites proposals for workshops that explore how computational design and digital fabrication can address these challenges. From climate adaptation and socio-political resilience to the integration of robotics and AI, we seek to harness the collective creativity of architects, designers, and technologists to redefine the future of the built environment. To enable broader access and a wider range of participants to the conference and workshops, proposals at all skill levels are encouraged to submit.  

Workshops will be held in person and online, leveraging state-of-the-art facilities and equipment at FIU and UM. We encourage proposals that engage with the conference theme and utilize the available resources to push the boundaries of digital design and fabrication.

## Workshop Themes  

We invite workshop proposals that explore the emerging intersections between technology and architecture, fostering innovation in design, fabrication, and interdisciplinary collaboration. Workshops should provide hands-on, exploratory, and experimental learning experiences for participants. We welcome submissions in the following thematic areas:

1. **Robotics, AI, and Architecture**: Investigating how robotic automation, machine learning, and AI-driven generative design reshape architectural processes and built environments.  

2. **Material Innovation and Digital Fabrication**: Exploring advanced computational design methods, innovative materials, and novel fabrication techniques for sustainable and responsive architecture.  

3. **Digital Tools for Cross-Disciplinary Design**: Examining digital workflows, collaborative platforms, and computational strategies that bridge architecture, engineering, and other disciplines.  

4. **Extended Reality (XR) for Generative Design and Virtual Prototyping**: Utilizing Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), and Mixed Reality (MR) to enhance generative design processes, immersive visualization, and digital-physical prototyping.

## Submission Requirements  

Workshop proposals should include the following:  

1. **Instructor Information**: Names, affiliations, bios, CVs, and links to previous teaching examples.  
2. **Workshop Title and Type**: Technical, seminar, or other.  
3. **Workshop Description**: Topics, learning objectives, required software, outcomes, and technical constraints.  
4. **Workshop Schedule**: Duration (1-3 days), daily breakdown, and hours per day (3-8 recommended).  
5. **Participant Information**: Optimal size, intended audience, and prerequisites.  
6. **Equipment and Materials**: List of required software, hardware, and materials.  
7. **Proposed Budget**: Itemized budget with anticipated costs and potential funding sources.
