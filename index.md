# ACADIA 2025:  Workshops Nov 3-5 + Conference Nov 6-8 / Miami, Florida

### [Florida International University](/fiu) and [University of Miami](/um)  

### Conference Theme

The ACADIA 2025 theme, **COMPUTING for RESILIENCE: Expanding Community Knowledge & Impact**, explores building resilience in an increasingly uncertain world, a challenge particularly relevant to Miami. As a city confronting significant physical, economic, and climatic challenges, Miami represents a microcosm of global issues, requiring innovative responses. Here, these challenges are not abstract; they are vividly apparent, making Miami both a hotspot for crisis and a hub of innovation. The city grapples with a unique convergence of issues—from restrictive educational policies and historical erasures to the constant threat of rising sea levels—each adding complexity to its future. However, this intense environment also positions Miami as a precedent-setting city for resilience and adaptation.

In the context of computation and fabrication in architecture, this theme invites the exploration of advanced solutions and resilient design methods that can adapt to these uncertainties. How can computational tools enhance our capacity to predict and mitigate the impacts of climate change? What role can technology play in shaping a future built environment that withstands political and economic shifts? This conference aims to harness the collective expertise and creativity of architects, designers, and technologists to address these questions. We will explore how innovative computational tools and fabrication techniques can transform Miami into a resilient and forward-thinking urban landscape, setting a new global standard for cities. By tackling these challenges, we aim to expand community knowledge and create lasting impacts beyond the field of architecture, turning Miami's pressures into opportunities for pioneering urban solutions.
