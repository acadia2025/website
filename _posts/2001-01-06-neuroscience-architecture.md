## Workshop Description
This one-day online workshop is divided into two parts:

**Part 1** introduces architects and designers to Neuroscience for Architecture (NfA), its history, relevance, and key contributors. It covers how neuroscience informs spatial perception, cognition, and behavior, and surveys design work where NfA principles have been applied. Core concepts such as memory, attention, sensory processing, and spatial cognition will be introduced, along with methods for integrating neuroscience into architectural thinking.

**Part 2** demonstrates an NfA approach using behavioral proxy modeling through Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) as a tool for understanding spatial cognition and neurological diversity. Participants will work with pre-coded ABM scripts in Rhino + Grasshopper to explore human navigation patterns informed by neurodiverse traits. The focus is on adjusting simplified parameters, such as memory decay or landmark reliance, and analyzing how design choices impact movement and engagement.

Through structured demonstrations and hands-on exercises, participants will examine how spatial conditions like corridor width or sequence influence agent behavior. The final output is a visually structured PDF with heatmaps and design reflections. The workshop provides an accessible entry into neuroscience-informed design thinking without requiring coding expertise. It offers architects a method for exploring spatial equity, resilience, and inclusion using behavioral proxies, not as a clinical or diagnostic tool.

## Key Learning Outcomes
- **Understand core principles** in neuroscience for architecture (NfA) approach in design
- **Understand an example of NfA work** related to spatial navigation: memory, attention, and sensory regulation
- **Learn to adjust behavior parameters** within ABM tools to model cognitive diversity
- **Interpret simulation outputs** in relation to layout decisions and design strategies
