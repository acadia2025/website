# Registration Opening Soon

## Workshop Team
**Johannes Braumann**, Creative Robotics, Association for Robots in Architecture  
**Karl Singline**, Creative Robotics  
**Emanuel Gollob**, Creative Robotics

## Workshop Description
In this workshop, we will collaboratively prototype complex cognitive robotic systems that respond to real-time sensor input. Drawing from multiple data sources, participants will develop integrated workflows that directly inform physical fabrication processes.

The workshop leverages the visual programming environment Grasshopper to enable highly customized, geometrically intricate path planning. However, the workshop extends beyond Grasshopper, guiding participants through a novel workflow that links the Grasshopper environment to external control systems, streaming data that drives real-time updates of the physical environment for digital fabrication.

Participants will be among the first to explore the brand-new Parametric Robot Control - the successor to KUKA&#124;prc - offering robust simulation and control of myriad industrial and collaborative robots. Purpose-built for seamless integration across diverse programming environments, the new framework acts as a versatile backbone for a complete range of robotic applications.

Attendees will stream data from various sources, from accessing robot-integrated sensor data to utilizing advanced hi-precision 3D vision systems such as Photoneo's MotionCam series, translating real-time insights directly to a fabrication workflow.

The workshop targets participants with basic programming experience, ideally in Grasshopper, C# and/or Python, but not essential.

## Key Learning Outcomes
