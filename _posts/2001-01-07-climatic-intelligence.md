## Workshop Description
As climate patterns shift and extremes intensify, the design of architectural envelopes must evolve from static protective barriers into dynamic, data-informed systems capable of responding to future environmental conditions. This advanced online workshop explores how computational simulations, multi-objective optimization, and climate-forward thinking can inform the design of adaptive building skins that enhance thermal comfort, reduce energy use, and anticipate future climate scenarios.

Focusing on the integration of environmental performance and generative design, the workshop will explore how adaptive facades can respond to projected climate change conditions while optimizing for comfort, airflow, and energy efficiency. Participants will work with real-time simulation engines and future weather data (EPW 2050/2080) to analyze thermal performance, daylighting, and natural ventilation using Ladybug Tools and Eddy3D (CFD). Through intuitive workflows and a customizable parametric model, attendees will simulate scenarios using CFD, solar radiation, and comfort metrics (PMV, UTCI), on a pre-modeled skin, then apply multi-objective optimization to explore intelligent design evolution.

No prior expertise in simulation tools is required, participants will be guided through the process of transforming climate data into meaningful design feedback, with all software being open-source or freely available. Using a pre-constructed parametric facade model, attendees will learn to simulate, evaluate, and evolve envelope systems based on metrics such as airflow performance, radiation shielding, daylight autonomy, and PMV/UTCI comfort indices.

This is a data-grounded, forward-looking workshop that bridges simulation and design intelligence in the context of climate resilience. By the end of the session, attendees will gain hands-on experience in building performance simulation, environmental visualization, and adaptive design strategies that respond to both present and future climates. This workshop is ideal for architects, researchers, educators, and students who want to push the boundaries of performance-driven design in the age of climate adaptation.

## Learning Outcomes
- **Use climate data and future weather files** to evaluate design resilience
- **Simulate airflow and natural ventilation performance** with Eddy3D (OpenFOAM)
- **Conduct solar and daylight analysis** for shading system performance
- **Evaluate indoor thermal comfort (PMV, UTCI)** across different envelope geometries
- **Run multi-objective optimizations** using Galapagos
- **Strategize facade adaptation mechanisms** based on simulation feedback

## Workshop Schedule
The workshop is designed as a **1-day intensive session (6–7 hours total)**, ideal for deep immersion and focused learning in an online setting. Alternatively, it can be delivered as a **2-day split format (3–3.5 hours per day)** to better accommodate different time zones and reduce screen fatigue.
