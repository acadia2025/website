## Workshop Description
We tend to think of ceramics as an environmentally friendly industry, the reason to make it a popular hobby for many of us. But, is this claim real? Robert Harrison in his book Sustainable Ceramics mentions: "Ceramics with all its necessities for manufacturing, materials, firing, fuels and workspace is certainly not a clean/green environment." Gas emissions, waste management, transportation and energy consumption are just a few of the characteristics that turn this process into one that negatively impacts our environment.

We decided to reevaluate the potentials of ceramics, keeping the connection between materiality and nature, extensive access to raw materials, geometrical freedom and strength. But reducing some of the harmful traits by using a locally sourced largely found lightweight waste product: eggshells, together with bio-binders that allow the mix to solidify without the need of firing. The process is based on 3D printing with a robotic arm, and additive fabrication process that allows efficient use of material (less waste), geometrical freedom, precision and repeatability.

In this workshop the participants will learn: about the state of the art in digital fabrication, how to prepare the material, how it interacts with the fabrication process, how select and apply computational solutions that can respond to the restrictions of the mix, and how to turn the 3D information into information that can be performed by the robot. Our objective is to raise awareness about innovation in fabrication processes, sustainable materials, the necessity to bring new trends into our design processes and questioning our current processes to move towards better ones in the future.

## The Eggshell Project Context
A third of the production of food intended for human consumption is lost or wasted worldwide, which is equivalent to approximately 1,300 million tons per year. An estimated 17% of all food available to consumers in 2019 ended up in landfills at households, retailers, restaurants and other food services, according to new UN research conducted as part of global efforts to reduce waste in half by 2030. The weight is equivalent to approximately 23 million fully loaded 40-ton trucks, enough to circle the Earth seven times (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, 2019).

Mexico is the 4th largest consumer of eggs worldwide with 28 kg of eggs per capita (Helgi Library 2020) and 5th largest egg producer in the world with 3,000,026 tons per year (FAO 2022). The per capita consumption of the Mexican is 28.0 kg per year, considered the fourth largest producer of eggs worldwide and is responsible for 1/27 eggs produced in the world (Sader). Landfilling contributes to greenhouse gas emissions and creates environmental problems due to microbial decomposition.

THE EGGSHELL PROJECT / UN PROYECTO DE HUEVO is a research project that seeks to take advantage of and transform our waste to turn it into a buildable material and open up a new possibility to create our living in an environmentally responsible way. In this project we create a bioceramic made from eggshell and combine it with sustainable aggregates, resulting in a new materiality, which seeks to reduce food waste and generate new opportunities. Our process is based on 3D printing with a KUKA KR-150 robotic arm and an extruder, which allows us to shape our blocks with different geometries and project them into different architectural applications.

## Workshop Process
The workshop will begin with an introductory talk, followed by hands-on sessions focused on material preparation and the 3D printing of a scaled prototype brick, designed using Rhino Vault software. Participants will also engage in an introductory exercise on computational design methods to generate the desired forms. The workshop will conclude with an open discussion on findings, insights, and perspectives.

### Material Preparation Process
1. **Get the whole eggs**, they boil 35 min. and washed twice
2. **The shell is crushed** to its minimum expression to obtain very little grain
3. **The egg is weighed**, then we prepare the mix with the organic binders
4. **The digital file is prepared**, from a Grasshopper file to KUKA SRC, to communicate with the robot
5. **The mix with the eggshell and water** until the mixture has a plastic consistency
6. **Material extrusion tests** are carried out with the robotic arm and the extruder to obtain its best physical condition
7. **The geometry is digitally printed** on the robotic arm
8. **It is left to dry** for less than 24 hours to find its final drying

## Learning Outcomes
In CIRCULAR BRICK: Robotic 3D-Printed Bricks Using Biomaterials, participants will learn the fundamentals of robotic 3D printing with bio-ceramics. We will explore state-of-the-art digital fabrication techniques, learn how to prepare the eggshell-based mix for extrusion, and apply computational strategies to adapt designs to the constraints and opportunities of the material and process. By the end of the workshop, participants will be able to print their own modular brick designs. This is not only a technical workshop, but also an open dialogue on the potential of sustainable and innovative practices, particularly within the fields of design and architecture.
