# Registration Opening Soon

## Workshop Team
**Instructor**: **Amin Adelzadeh**  
Doctoral Fellow, CITA - Royal Danish Academy, Denmark

**Guest Critics**:  
**Prof. Mette Ramsgaard Thomsen** and **Prof. Martin Tamke**  
CITA - Royal Danish Academy, Denmark

*The workshop will conclude with a session where participants' outcomes may be reviewed by CITA faculty critics, offering expert feedback and recommendations, subject to their availability.*

## Workshop Description
This intensive three-day online workshop introduces participants to the future of timber design workflows, where conversational AI acts as a collaborator in crafting complex joinery systems. By exploring a fully automated design-to-fabrication pipeline, attendees will learn how to translate natural-language prompts into production-ready C# code, directly executable within Rhino's Grasshopper environment.

The focus is on generating comprehensive digital outputs—custom parametric components, joint typologies, and fabrication-ready datasets—establishing a seamless prompt-to-code and code-to-geometry workflow. Participants will leave with a library of diverse joinery solutions and tools for integrating AI-driven design into their own timber projects.

## Keywords
AI-Driven Design, Prompt Engineering, Computational Timber Design, Timber Joinery Systems, Fabrication Data Automation

## Learning Objectives
By completion of the workshop, participants will be able to:
- **Engineer Effective Prompts**: Craft clear, unambiguous natural-language prompts to define joint typologies, dimensions, and input/output data structures for automated C# code generation
- **Steer AI Code Generation**: Configure system and user prompts to guide ChatGPT in producing clean, modular C# scripts compatible with Grasshopper's scripting API
- **Develop a Joinery Library**: Generate a variety of joint systems—from finger and lap joints to bespoke connections—within a unified prompt framework
- **Create Custom Grasshopper Components**: Build and refine tailored C# components for rapid deployment across timber models
- **Integrate and Test Components**: Apply generated components within structural models (frames, trusses), managing data trees and geometric alignment
- **Iterate and Debug**: Use prompt-and-test cycles to refine code, add UI elements, and handle errors for robust workflows

## Intended Outcomes
Participants will leave the workshop with:
1. A prompt-to-C# workflow template for generating custom Grasshopper components on demand
2. A library of parametric joinery components, designed for automated application in timber structures
3. A worked example structural model (e.g., a frame or grid) populated with bespoke joints
4. Comprehensive documentation, including prompt samples, code snippets, and step-by-step guides
5. Strategies for scaling and automating the pipeline, such as macro scripting, version control, and library management

This workshop delivers a focused, Grasshopper-only workflow that combines conversational AI with parametric design, enabling participants to prototype and implement custom timber joinery systems directly from natural-language prompts.

## Technical Constraints & Requirements

### Software
- Rhino 7 (or later) with Grasshopper
- Access to a GPT-based model (e.g., via OpenAI API or Web UI)

### Hardware
- Laptop with at least 16 GB RAM and Windows or macOS compatible with Rhino

### Dependencies
- No additional plugins beyond standard Grasshopper components; all scripting done in native C# or Python scripting components

## Participant Information
To ensure everyone can hit the ground running, the following familiarity is preferred but not required—enthusiastic beginners are welcome:

- **Rhino & Grasshopper**: Familiarity with navigating Rhino 7+ and assembling basic Grasshopper definitions
- **Scripting in Grasshopper**: Familiarity with reading or writing simple Python or C# scripts within Grasshopper's scripting components
- **AI Prompting**: Familiarity with formulating natural-language prompts using a GPT-based model
- **Hardware & Software Setup**: Laptop (Windows or macOS) with at least 16 GB RAM and Rhino 7+ installed, active access to a GPT model (via API key or web interface)
- **Basic Timber Joinery Knowledge**: Familiarity with common joinery types or a willingness to learn and to iterate on design

Participants without prior experience in any of these areas will still be able to follow along and learn through guided instruction.
