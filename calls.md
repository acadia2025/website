# Calls for Submissions

## Conference Theme

The ACADIA 2025 theme, COMPUTING for RESILIENCE: Expanding Community Knowledge & Impact, explores building resilience in an increasingly uncertain world, a challenge particularly relevant to Miami. As a city confronting significant physical, economic, and climatic challenges, Miami represents a microcosm of global issues, requiring innovative responses. Here, these challenges are not abstract; they are vividly apparent, making Miami both a hotspot for crisis and a hub of innovation. The city grapples with a unique convergence of issues—from restrictive educational policies and historical erasures to the constant threat of rising sea levels—each adding complexity to its future. However, this intense environment also positions Miami as a precedent-setting city for resilience and adaptation.

In the context of computation and fabrication in architecture, this theme invites the exploration of advanced solutions and resilient design methods that can adapt to these uncertainties. How can computational tools enhance our capacity to predict and mitigate the impacts of climate change? What role can technology play in shaping a future built environment that withstands political and economic shifts? This conference aims to harness the collective expertise and creativity of architects, designers, and technologists to address these questions. We will explore how innovative computational tools and fabrication techniques can transform Miami into a resilient and forward-thinking urban landscape, setting a new global standard for cities. By tackling these challenges, we aim to expand community knowledge and create lasting impacts beyond the field of architecture, turning Miami's pressures into opportunities for pioneering urban solutions.

## We anticipate several subthemes for paper calls, including the following:

### Computational Strategies for Climate Adaptation
This sub-theme focuses on the role of computational tools and digital technologies in developing strategies for sustainability and climate resilience. It invites papers that explore how advanced modeling, simulation, and data analysis can predict environmental impacts and inform design decisions that mitigate climate risks. Topics may include:
    - Climate Responsive Architecture
    - Adaptive Building Systems, Building Performance Optimisation
    - Material Computation


### Integrating Robotics and AI in Architecture and Construction
This subtheme examines the integration of robotics, artificial intelligence, and machine learning in architecture and construction. It seeks contributions that investigate how these technologies can optimize construction processes, enhance precision and efficiency, and facilitate innovative design solutions. Papers might address:
    - Automation in Construction
    - Robotics, Digital Fabrication, Biodesign and Construction
    - AI-driven Design, Predictive Modelling, and Optimization
    - Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)
    - Spatial Computing and Extended Reality (VR/AR/MR)


### Sociopolitical and Economic Resilience through Digital Design
This subtheme explores the intersection of digital design practices with socio-political and economic resilience. It invites papers that consider how computational tools can help design environments that respond to socio-political challenges, such as economic inequality, social justice, and policy constraints. Topics may include:
    - Community-based Design
    - Participatory Digital Platforms
    - Resilience Planning & Strategies 
    - Theories, Pedagogies, Philosophies, and Methodologies


### Space Innovations for a Sustainable and Resilient Earth
This sub-theme explores how systems designed for space exploration translate to enhancing Earth's sustainability in the face of climate change. It invites papers that consider how technologies and social structures developed for resource-constrained, remote space environments inform architectural innovation on Earth. Papers may investigate:
    - Closed-Loop Systems in Architecture 
    - Sensor-Driven Smart Environments
    - Extreme Environment Design and Resilience Strategies
    - Designing space societies: from habitability to governance
